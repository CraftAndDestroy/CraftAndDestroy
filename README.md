# Hiya

I'm FloofyPlasma. These days I'm mostly working on FOSS. I have quite a bit of experience with Luau, and various dialects of C. I specialize in modularizing and refactoring code.
I try to contribute to open source projects that I find interesting.

# Current Projects

I'm currently working with [@pyxfluff](https://github.com/pyxfluff) on Administer.

Check out our work in the following repositories:

- [Administer](https://github.com/administer-org/administer)
- [UI Components](https://github.com/administer-org/ui-components)
- [Apps](https://github.com/administer-org/apps)
